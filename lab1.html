            <h2>Image</h2>
            <p>Images are a media type displayed as visual information. They can be drawings, photographs, or paintings. Images are used to create interest and provide clear information.</p>

            <h2>Types of Images:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Raster Images</li>
                <li>Vector Images</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Difference between Raster & Vector Images:</h2>
            <p>The Raster images are formed by pixels, whereas vector images are formed using mathematical expressions, lines, and curves with fixed checkpoints.</p>

            <h2>Color Model</h2>
            <p>It is a system of categorizing all possible color in terms of numbers representing proportions of basic hues.</p>
            <h2>Pixels</h2>
            <p>Pixel is the smallest elements of an imageon a computer display. A Screen is made up of a matrix of thousands or millions of pixels. A Pixel is represented with a dot oir a square on a computer system.</p>
            <h2>Resolution </h2>
            <p>Resolution is a measure used to describe the sharpness and clarity of an image or picture. It is often used as a metric for judging the quality of monitors, printers, digital images and various other hardwareand software technologies.</p>
            <h2>DPI</h2>
            <p>DPI is the acronym of Dots Per Inch, it is a measure of the resolution of a printed document or a disital scan.</p>
            <h2>Video</h2>
            <p>A video is used to generate a steady source of still pictures as it is a series of electropnic signals, which simulate movement.</p>
            <h2>Video Format</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>MP4 – one of the most universal formats, compatible with the majority of digital resources and platforms. While being one of the highly compressed video formats, it provides a decent quality of the visual.
                </li>
                <li>MOV – an Apple’s creation developed for QuickTime player. Nevertheless, it is compatible with other software as well. The principal drawback is the large file size, but the visual quality is beyond all praise.</li>
                <li>AVI – a good old-fashioned and battle-tested format, compatible with the majority of codecs and players.</li>
                <li></li>WMV – as the very name implies, this container uses MWV codecs, which ensure the smallest size possible. Quite logically, it provokes a significant quality loss, but the file may be sent via e-mail or even SMS.</li>
                <li>FLV – this format was developed for flash videos, and is now less popular than it used to be several years ago.</li>
                <li>MKV – this container is still evolving, and it’s compatible with a few players only. On the other hand, it can use the majority of codecs and provides quite a high quality (at the cost of a size, of course).</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>HTML/Hypertext </h2>
            <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page. HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other. </p>
            <h2>Hosting </h2>
            <p>Hosting, in its most generic sense, is a service through which storage and computing resources are providing to an individual or organization for the accommodation and maintenance of one or more websites and related services. While hosting doesn’t need to be IP-based, the vast majority of instances are web-based services that allow a website or web service to be globally accessible from the Internet.</p>
            <h2>Multimedia </h2>
            <p>The word multi and media are combined to form the word multimedia. The word “multi” signifies “many.” Multimedia is a type of medium that allows information to be easily transferred from one location to another. 
                Multimedia is the presentation of text, pictures, audio, and video with links and tools that allow the user to navigate, engage, create, and communicate using a computer.
